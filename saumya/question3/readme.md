# 2 - 1 = 1

There is too much noise. Try noise cancellation.

## Solution

Primary audio file contains the First Part of the flag "FINLEY" in Morse Code. Outputmixed audio file has the second part "BREESE" mixed with the primary audio. So user has to invert the primary audio and play with outputmixed audio to hear the second flag clearly.
