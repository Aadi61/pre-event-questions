3. Cryptographic Hash Analysis
Question: Which of the following best describes a 'preimage attack' in cryptographic hash functions?

2) Finding two different messages that produce the same hash
3) Decrypting the hash to retrieve the original message
4) Altering the message without changing the hash
Answer: 1) Finding a message that corresponds to a specific hash
